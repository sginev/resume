Hi!. This is a personal project to create a website to display my resume.

It is a **[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/)** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

Content is written in Markdown and is provided and updated via **[TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org)**.

## Getting Started

Just run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

Currently, the website is deployed on **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. The deployment is automated  via **Github Actions** and triggered on push to the **`master`** branch.
