  Other than some of the projects mentioned above, I worked a on various browser
  games, including a 3D casual fight-game, where I wrote the client and
  multiplayer server logic (in actionscript and JAVA respectively). We also did
  a few cross-platform games for mobile, such as a physics based casual game
  with map editor, skill and reaction games and a smaller projects. Most of
  these titles were designed technically and game-wise by our own team, with few
  pointers or requirements from clients.

Delivered several apps and games for browsers and mobile in collaboration with the team. Handled visuals, game play, and front-end-to-back-end communication protocols and strategies.

Devised the game play section of a casual Android/iOS game. Aside from trigonometry, mock-physics, and ads integration, specific work was aimed at adding polish and spectacle, to what resulted in one of the firm's most visually engaging projects.

Developed a complex mobile billiards app for a foreign market. The project involved real-time physics simulation, low-level shader programming, multiplayer logic in C#, in-app purchases, player progression, and live tournaments.
