A PWA (progressive web application), and an ongoing personal passion project, which aims to present a novel experience, combining the visual minimalism of 'choose-your-own-adventure' books with the openness of traditional computer games. On the surface, the app is text animated with Three.js and jQuery animations, behind the scenes, it blends scripted events and dialogue with procedural sentence generation (think "online chat-bots") and an AI narrative director orchestrating a modular story at a reasonable pace. AngularJS was used to build both the game client and a custom tool for editing all characters, locations, special events, and dialog/narration snippets.
