name: Stefan Ginev
introduction: |
  I started with UI design mockups and over the last decade went deeper and deeper into work, which involved more complex code structure, good patterns, and project planning - from one project to the next, often requiring skills in new languages, frameworks or third-party services, which depending on the product, can be immensely exciting.

  I have a deep interest in my industry, but I am most passionate about innovative, interesting game or app ideas. Although I haven't done official work as such, I also have professional interest in, and study as much as I can about game-design.
introProjects: |
  I have worked on a number of projects both at the office, and at home. These include games and apps, realized via different technologies for web, android and flash (when it was cool). I handle mostly front-end business and visual logic; my back-end work consists predominantly of multiplayer server logic, and simple rest api and websites.
introExperience: ''
miscellaneous: |
  Whether as personal projects or to assist my workflow at the office, I've also familiarized myself over the years with several online and self hosted cloud IDEs, such as Gitpod, CodeServer (vscode in the browser) and Cloud9 (when that was cool) and I've learned the basics of CI (vsonline/azure, Cirrus, Bitbucket's own, etc)

  Ocassionally I work on some home-automation/IOT projects, utilizing a box of pies at home and the best and cheapest Aliexpress has to offer in terms of gadgets, switches, etc.
